# Python_PostgreSQL
Introduction

This project showcases a simple Python script that utilizes the psycopg2 module to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The script covers three main features: sorting records by name, searching records by state, and updating the state of a specific record. It demonstrates how to connect to the PostgreSQL database, create a table if it doesn't exist, and perform these operations on the table.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    PostgreSQL database
    psycopg2 module (install using pip install psycopg2)

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_PostgreSQL.git
cd Python_PostgreSQL

Set Up PostgreSQL:

Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the Python scripts.

Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install psycopg2

Run the Scripts:

    Feature 1: Sort Records by Name

    bash

python feature1_sort_records.py

Feature 2: Search Records by State

bash

python feature2_search_records.py

Feature 3: Update Record

bash

        python feature3_update_record.py

    Follow the on-screen instructions to execute each feature.

Project Structure

    feature1_sort_records.py: Sorts records in the PostgreSQL database by name.
    feature2_search_records.py: Searches records in the PostgreSQL database by state.
    feature3_update_record.py: Updates the state of a specific record in the PostgreSQL database.
    utils.py: Contains common functions used across features.
    README.md: Project documentation.

Features

    Sort Records by Name:
        The script sorts records in the PostgreSQL database by the 'name' column.

    Search Records by State:
        The script prompts the user to enter a state and then searches for records in the PostgreSQL database based on the specified state.

    Update Record:
        The script allows the user to update the state of a specific record in the PostgreSQL database by entering the record ID and the new state.
